        <h2>Welcome</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Hi, my name is Dhrumit Bhakta, and I'm new to the programming world. My goal in college is to successfully complete my degree. In my free time, I enjoy playing video games, editing videos or pictures, and watching movies. 
        I have some experience with HTML, but I don't have experience with CSS. In this course, my objective is to gain a better understanding of both HTML and CSS.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>I spend my time with my family.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I play videogames with my friends.</li>
            <li>When I have nothing to do, I edit some videos and pictures using Adobe Premiere Pro and Photoshop, sometimes After Effects, to upload them to my social media.</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
            <p>My favorite web site is <a href="https://www.youtube.com">YouTube</a> when I'm bored or have nothing to do, I enjoy watching videos.</p>
