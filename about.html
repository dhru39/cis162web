    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi, my name is Dhrumit Bhakta, and I'm new to the programming world. My goal in college is to successfully complete my degree. In my free time, I enjoy playing video games, editing videos or pictures, and watching movies. 
    I have some experience with HTML, but I don't have experience with CSS. In this course, my objective is to gain a better understanding of both HTML and CSS. I'm also gradually developing a Python backend app to automate some tasks.</p>
    <h1>When I have free time</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>I spend my time with my family.</li>
        <li>Sometimes I play videogames with my friends.</li>
        <li>When I have nothing to do, I edit some videos and pictures using Adobe Premiere Pro and Photoshop, sometimes After Effects, to upload them to my social media.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>My favorite web site is <a href="https://www.youtube.com">YouTube</a> when I'm bored or have nothing to do, I enjoy watching videos. </p>
